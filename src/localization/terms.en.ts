# **1.**  **Scope**

These Terms of Service (the “Terms”) govern your use of the GovGen Governance decentralized application (“GovGen dApp”), access to our web-hosted user interface located at https\://app\.govgen.io (the “Site”) and related tools, trademarks, intellectual property, services, and software provided by All in Bits, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “operator,” “we,” or “us”). These Terms apply to all users of the GovGen dApp (collectively, the “Services”). For simplicity, the Site and our Services are collectively referred to as the “Interface.”

The Interface is intended to provide decentralized governance tools and a forum for user-generated content through which individuals and decentralized autonomous organizations (“**_DAOs_**”) and their members may conduct certain on-chain governance functionalities. Due to the decentralized nature of the Interface, we do not monitor or control all interactions. By using this Interface, you acknowledge that we are not responsible for any third-party actions or transactions that occur outside of our direct control. Certain services may only be available in specific jurisdictions, and nothing herein grants you access to services in jurisdictions where they are prohibited.

The Interface does not include any outside websites or platforms linked to it. Such external platforms have their own terms of service, which govern transactions on those platforms. We disclaim any liability for transactions conducted outside the Interface.

These Terms expressly cover your rights and obligations, and our disclaimers and limitations of legal liability,  relating to your use of, and access to, the Interface. By accessing or using the Interface, you agree to be bound by these Terms. Before using the Interface, make sure that you read and understand the accompanying [Privacy Policy](https://app.govgen.io/privacy).

THESE TERMS SET FORTH THE LEGALLY BINDING TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOUR RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS, OUR DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS OF LEGAL LIABILITY THAT GOVERN YOUR USE OF THE INTERFACE. BY SIGNING MESSAGE TO BE RECORDED ON-CHAIN THAT INCLUDES A LINK TO THESE TERMS ACCESSING OR USING THE INTERFACE, YOU ARE ACCEPTING THESE TERMS (ON BEHALF OF YOURSELF OR THE ENTITY THAT YOU REPRESENT), INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION IN SECTION 17 AND WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THE PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS, DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE INTERFACE.

# **2.**  **The Interface**

GovGen dApp is a decentralized governance platform allowing users to participate in the governance processes of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) within the AtomOne Hub and Cosmos ecosystem. The dApp provides access to the decentralized network and enables users to submit proposals, vote on governance matters, and perform other governance-related actions. Participation in GovGen requires interaction with compatible wallet and blockchain transactions, including staking and voting. All transactions performed through the GovGen dApp are irreversible and publicly recorded on the blockchain.

1. **Wallets and Security:**

To use the GovGen Interface, you must connect a compatible third-party wallet (e.g., Keplr, Leap, Cosmostation). The Interface does not store private keys or have access to your funds. You are solely responsible for safeguarding your wallet credentials, including private keys and seed phrases, which are essential for accessing your wallet and digital assets.

The operator will never request your private keys, seed phrases, or recovery phrases. Any such request should be considered fraudulent and reported immediately. Failing to safeguard this information may result in the permanent loss of access to your wallet and digital assets.

For enhanced security, users have the option to generate command-line interface (CLI) commands for executing transactions in an offline, air-gapped environment. This method allows users to create and sign transactions on a device that is not connected to the internet, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access, hacking, or malware attacks. Once the transaction is signed offline, it can be securely transmitted to the network using an internet-connected device. This adds an extra layer of protection when performing sensitive actions such as transferring funds or managing governance operations.

It is crucial that users strictly follow best practices for secure transaction processing, including keeping private keys secure and ensuring that the air-gapped environment is free from vulnerabilities. Failure to adhere to these best practices could lead to compromised security, resulting in the loss of assets or unauthorized actions being taken on the user’s behalf.

2. **Fees:** 

Using the Interface may also require that you pay a fee, such as gas charges on the blockchain, to perform a transaction. **You acknowledge and agree that the operator has no control over any such third-party transactions, the method of payment of such transactions, or any actual payments of transactions.** All fees are non-refundable, so you must ensure that you have a sufficient balance of the applicable cryptocurrency tokens stored at your protocol-compatible wallet address to complete any transaction on the blockchain or Interface before initiating such a transaction.

If you accept cryptocurrency or fiat payments from other users in the Interface, you bear all risk of loss from such transactions. Any payments made by you to other users are non-refundable, and the operator takes no responsibility for disputes arising between users related to such transactions.

3. **Changes to the Interface**

The Interface is continually evolving, with ongoing developments that include advanced governance features such as proposal creation, voting insights, and individual user voting histories. As these features are released and integrated, the operator reserves the right to update or modify the functionality of the Interface. These updates may also lead to adjustments in the terms governing the use of the Interface.

For features that involve open-source contributions, those contributions will be governed by separate open-source licenses, as appropriate. The operator is not responsible for third-party contributions, though it may integrate or collaborate with them to enhance the functionality of the Interface. You agree that it is your responsibility to stay informed about any updates to these Terms or features by periodically reviewing them on the Interface.


# **3.**  **Your Permission to Use the Interface**

Subject to these Terms, the operator grants you a non-transferable, limited right to use the Interface, provided you comply with these terms. This permission is personal to you and cannot be assigned or transferred to others. Each user must individually agree to these terms in order to access and use the Interface.


# **4.**  **Conditions for Use of the Interface**

Your permission to use the Interface is contingent upon the following conditions:

- **For Individuals:** You must be of legal age in your jurisdiction and possess the legal capacity to enter into and be bound by these Terms.

- **For Organizations:** If you are using the Interface on behalf of an organization, you represent and warrant that you have the necessary authority to bind that organization to these Terms.

- **Revocation of Access:** You must cease using the Interface if the operator informs you that you are no longer permitted to use it.

This includes activities related to money laundering, illegal gambling, financing of terrorism, or any other criminal or illegal activity.

   2. **Regional Restrictions:** You may not use the Interface if you are located in a country subject to U.S. government sanctions or that has been designated by the U.S. government as a “terrorist supporting” country.

   3. **Prohibited Use by U.S. Persons and Restricted Persons:** The Interface, Services, and any other features offered or made available are not intended for use by U.S. Persons or Restricted Persons, and any such use is strictly prohibited. U.S. Persons include any natural person or legal entity who resides, is located, is incorporated, or has a registered office in the United States of America. Restricted Persons are those residing, located, incorporated, or having a registered office in any Restricted Jurisdiction.

   4. **VPN and Anonymization Tools:** The use of virtual private networks (VPNs) or any other privacy or anonymization tools or techniques to circumvent, or attempt to circumvent, these restrictions is expressly prohibited.

   5. **Violation Consequences:** The operator reserves all rights to take action against any individual or entity violating, circumventing, or attempting to circumvent these restrictions, including but not limited to, legal action, temporary or permanent restriction of access to the Interface.

# **6.**  **Enforcement**

The operator takes violations of these Terms, including those outlined in the Acceptable Use and Content Standards, seriously and may investigate any potential violations to the fullest extent permitted by law. If a violation is detected, the operator reserves the right to take any and all of the following actions:

1. **Investigation and Cooperation with Authorities**: The operator may initiate investigations into any suspected violations of these Terms, including, but not limited to, illegal activities or actions that compromise the integrity of the Interface. The operator may also cooperate with law enforcement authorities to investigate and prosecute violations of the law and/or these Terms. This may include disclosing relevant information about your use of the Interface to law enforcement authorities as required by law or in the operator’s discretion.

2) **Content Moderation**: The operator reserves the right to change, redact, remove, or delete any content submitted to or appearing on the Interface that it deems to be in violation of these Terms, particularly those specified in the **Acceptable Use and Content Standards**. The operator may act without prior notice and at its sole discretion. Users are encouraged to report any content they believe to be in violation of these Terms immediately. The operator will review and, if necessary, take appropriate action to address reported violations.

3. **Transaction Refusal and Restrictions**: The operator may, at any time and at its sole discretion, refuse any transaction, including, but not limited to, purchase, sale, or transfer requests submitted via the Interface. The operator also reserves the right to impose additional conditions, limitations, or restrictions on your use of the Interface. This may include limitations on certain features or transaction capabilities if the operator suspects misuse or a violation of these Terms.

4) **Suspension or Termination of Access**: In cases of serious or repeated violations, or where illegal activity is suspected, the operator reserves the right to suspend or permanently revoke your access to the Interface without prior notice. This includes, but is not limited to, cases where users submit false, fraudulent, or manipulative proposals or votes, engage in unauthorized access, or otherwise act in violation of the Acceptable Use and Content Standards.

5. **Interface Availability**: The operator reserves the right, at any time and for any reason, to make the Interface unavailable, either temporarily or permanently, at its sole discretion and without prior notice. This includes, but is not limited to, taking the Interface offline for maintenance, upgrades, or to address security concerns.

6) **User Reports**: If you believe another user has violated these Terms, you may contact the operator with details regarding the alleged violation. The operator will review your report and take appropriate action, which may include investigating the user’s conduct and enforcing the measures outlined in this section.

7. **Liability for Violations**: If your use of the Interface results in any harm, damage, or liability to the operator or other users, you may be held liable for those damages, and the operator may take legal action to recover its losses.


# **7.**  **Your Information**

By using the Interface, you agree to the following responsibilities regarding the information you provide:

1. **Accuracy and Completeness**: You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information about yourself when prompted by any registration, subscription forms, or otherwise requested by the operator. This includes, but is not limited to, personal identification details, wallet addresses, and any information required for compliance with applicable laws or regulations.

2. **Security of Credentials**: You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your account credentials, including passwords, private keys, and any other forms of identification. The operator will never ask you to reveal your private keys, and you should take all necessary precautions to secure this information. Any unauthorized access or use of your account is solely your responsibility.

3. **Keeping Information Updated**: You agree to maintain and promptly update any information you have provided to ensure that it remains accurate, current, and complete at all times. This includes updating contact information, account details, and any other pertinent information as your circumstances change.

4. **Notification of Material Changes**: You agree to promptly notify the operator of any material changes that may affect your eligibility to use the Interface, including, but not limited to, changes in your residency, legal status, or ability to comply with any jurisdictional requirements or restrictions. Failure to notify the operator of such changes may result in suspension or termination of access to the Interface.

5. **Responsibility for Account Use**: You are fully responsible for all actions taken under your account, whether authorized or unauthorized. This includes any activities initiated through the Interface, such as proposals, votes, and other governance-related interactions. You acknowledge that failure to secure your account or disclose sensitive information (e.g., private keys, passwords) could result in unauthorized access and loss of assets. You will not hold the operator liable for any unauthorized actions resulting from your failure to secure your account credentials.


# **8.**  **Know Your Customer**

You acknowledge that the operator and its partners may perform Know Your Customer (“KYC”) procedures on the information you provide, as required by internal policies and as required by applicable guidelines or regulations. You consent to such KYC procedures.

You agree that this is a general requirement and in compliance with regulatory rules and guidance, and in no way creates or is deemed to be any form of recommendation or advice by the operator.

The operator may in its sole and absolute discretion decline to accept any person’s request in anything, at any time, with no requirement for any reason or explanation; you agree that such decline(s), if any, shall not constitute an opinion, recommendation or investment, legal or tax advice by the operator.


# **9.**  **Background Checks**

While the Interface emphasizes decentralized governance and privacy, certain roles within the ecosystem, such as validators or other key participants, may be subject to background checks in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, or internal policies. These background checks are conducted to ensure compliance with legal standards and to maintain the integrity of the network.

1. **Consent to Background Checks**: You acknowledge and consent that the operator and/or its partners may perform background checks on users when required by law or regulation, particularly for those participants holding sensitive roles within the network. These checks are intended to confirm that a user’s identity does not appear on any criminal, terrorist, or sanctions watchlists, and that they are not associated with any foreign governments under sanctions or scrutiny.

2. **Data Sources and Reliability**: The background check process relies on information obtained from a variety of regulatory, private, and public databases. While these sources are considered reliable, the operator cannot guarantee the accuracy or completeness of the information.

3. **Sharing of Background Check Information**: Information gathered during background checks may be shared with the operator’s partners or relevant regulatory bodies, as necessary, to comply with legal or regulatory requirements.

4. **Legal Obligations and Reporting**: The operator and its partners may have legal obligations under applicable laws, such as the USA PATRIOT Act or anti-money laundering regulations, to report suspicious activity. These obligations may require the operator to deny access to certain users based on background check results, including but not limited to individuals identified as high-risk or flagged under any relevant legal frameworks.

5. **Right to Deny Access**: The operator reserves the right to deny access to any products, services, or features offered through the Interface based on the results of background checks. This may occur even if the information obtained is not fully accurate, complete, or truthful, in line with regulatory obligations and the operator’s risk management policies.


# **10.**  **Your Content**

By submitting content to the Interface, you represent and warrant that you hold all necessary rights, licenses, and permissions to provide such content and that doing so does not infringe the intellectual property or other rights of any third party. You remain the sole owner of your content; however, by submitting content, you grant the operator and its affiliates a **perpetual, non-exclusive, transferable, royalty-free, worldwide license** to use, distribute, reproduce, and publicly display your content on the Interface, as well as for related purposes including promotion, analytics, and archives. This license will continue even after you remove your content from the Interface, to the extent necessary for compliance with legal obligations or for maintaining necessary backups and archives.

You acknowledge and agree that the operator is not responsible for the misuse of your content by other users or third parties. Any interactions with your content by other users, including sharing or modifying it, are their responsibility under the terms of use, and the operator disclaims all liability related to such misuse.

- **Operator’s Rights to Review or Modify Content**: The operator is not obligated to actively review, monitor, or edit any user-submitted content. However, we reserve the right to take down, obscure, or modify any content at our discretion, particularly if it violates these terms, infringes intellectual property rights, or is otherwise harmful or unlawful.

- **No Transfer of Ownership**: Submitting content to the Interface does not transfer ownership rights over that content to the operator. Similarly, the operator’s intellectual property rights remain with the operator, and you do not obtain any ownership rights to the operator’s content, designs, code, trademarks, or other intellectual property, unless explicitly granted in a separate agreement.

- **Your Responsibility for Content**: You are solely responsible for the content you submit. You must ensure that your content is lawful and does not imply any false association, endorsement, or sponsorship by the operator. The operator is under no obligation to store, maintain, or provide copies of any content you submit to the Interface.

- **License to Use Your Content**: While you retain ownership of your content, you grant the operator a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, sublicensable license to make your content available to other users of the Interface. This license permits the operator to copy, publish, analyze, and distribute your content as needed without further notification or compensation.

- **Removal of Content**: If your content is removed from the Interface, either by you or by the operator, the operator’s license to that content will expire once the last copy is deleted from backups, caches, and other systems. However, any sublicenses you grant to other users or third parties, or that the operator grants to its partners, may continue beyond the removal of your content.

- **Misuse of Content by Others**: You acknowledge that other users or third parties may misuse the content you submit, potentially violating the terms on which you licensed it. The operator cannot and will not be held responsible for these violations or any resulting damages or consequences.

- **Infringement of Intellectual Property**: The operator reserves the right to terminate, in its sole discretion, the accounts of any users who repeatedly infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others, whether related to content submitted to the Interface or other activities.


# **11.**  **Our Content**

Unless otherwise specified, the operator and/or its licensors own all intellectual property rights associated with the content made available on the Interface. This includes, but is not limited to, all product and service names, graphics, button icons, trademarks, service marks, logos, and any other materials presented on the Interface. Some images, videos, or other content displayed may be the property of third parties, in which case the operator uses them with proper authorization or under fair use principles. All intellectual property rights are reserved.

You may access and view content available on the Interface solely for your personal use, provided you adhere to the restrictions outlined in these terms.

You **may not**:

• Republish, sell, rent, sub-license, reproduce, duplicate, or copy content from the Interface, unless it is your own content, or content you are otherwise licensed or authorized to use.

• Redistribute content from the Interface unless the content has been specifically designated as available for redistribution.

• Use any content from the Interface in any commercial context without express written permission from the operator or the applicable rights holder.

**No Implied Licenses**:Nothing in these terms should be construed as granting you a license or right to use any of the operator’s intellectual property, except as expressly stated in this agreement. Unauthorized use of the operator’s intellectual property may result in legal consequences.

**Open-Source Contributions**: For the avoidance of doubt, the restrictions in this section do not apply to any content or software that has been explicitly contributed by the operator to the open-source community under an open-source license. Any content or software released under such a license is governed by the specific terms of that open-source license, which may permit broader use, distribution, and modification than otherwise allowed under these terms.

 **12. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) Compliance**

If you are a copyright holder and believe that content on the Interface infringes upon a copyright that you own or control, you may submit a formal DMCA notification to our designated agent. The operator will respond promptly to valid DMCA claims and, if necessary, remove or disable access to the infringing content.

To submit a DMCA notification, your written communication must include the following:

1. A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.

2. Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works.

3. Identification of the infringing material or the material that is the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to permit the operator to locate the material (e.g., URL or description of the specific location within the Interface).

4. Contact information for the complaining party, such as a mailing address, telephone number, and, if available, an email address.

5. A statement that the complaining party has a good-faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.

6. A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.

Please direct all DMCA notifications to the operator’s designated agent:

Carolyn Pehrson ACP # 153281

3395 South Jones Blvd. # 153

Las Vegas, NV 89146

Phone: 661-388-6953

Email: <legal@allinbits.com>

**Counter-Notification Process**

If your content is removed or disabled based on a DMCA notification, you have the right to submit a counter-notification if you believe the removal or disabling was the result of an error or misidentification of the material.

To submit a counter-notification, your written communication must include the following:

1. Your physical or electronic signature.

2. Identification of the material that has been removed or disabled, and the location where the material appeared before it was removed or disabled (e.g., URL or description of the specific location within the Interface).

3. A statement, under penalty of perjury, that you have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification.

4. Your contact information, including a mailing address, telephone number, and email address.

5. A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal court in the district where your address is located (or the federal court in Las Vegas, NV, if your address is outside of the United States), and that you will accept service of process from the party that filed the original DMCA notification or an agent of that party.

Once a valid counter-notification is received, the operator may restore the removed material, unless the original complainant files a court action seeking to restrain you from engaging in the allegedly infringing activity.


# **13.**  **Your Responsibility and Security**

You agree to reimburse the operator for all costs, damages, and legal claims arising from your breach of these terms or the misuse of the Interface by others using your account. Both parties agree to promptly notify each other of any legal claims related to this agreement. Failure by the operator to notify you promptly does not absolve you of your responsibility, except where prompt notice could have mitigated the issue. You agree to allow the operator to assume the investigation, defense, and settlement of any legal claims at its discretion. The operator agrees not to enter any settlement that places you at fault or imposes obligations on you without your consent.

**14. Disclaimers**

1. You acknowledge and accept all risks associated with the use of the Interface and its content. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the operator provides the Interface on an “as is” and “as available” basis, without any warranties of any kind, including, without limitation, implied or statutory warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, accuracy, reliability, availability, quiet enjoyment, or non-infringement of third-party rights.

2) You accept the inherent risks involved in using the Interface, including but not limited to risks associated with your financial, cryptocurrency, or other digital asset holdings and transfers. The operator is not liable for any losses, damages, or harm resulting from your use of the Interface, including those related to the disclosure of your private wallet keys—even if caused by a bug or error in the Interface.

3. We make no warranties regarding compatibility with your mobile device, carrier, or third-party software/hardware. Your use of the Interface may be subject to third-party terms (e.g., agreements with your mobile device manufacturer), and the operator disclaims responsibility for these terms.

4) Access to your cryptocurrency tokens or assets may be interrupted, delayed, or terminated at any time, potentially affecting the value or execution of transactions. The operator assumes no liability for such disruptions. You bear full responsibility for ensuring the security of your private keys, seed phrases, and other sensitive wallet information. Loss of this information may result in permanent loss of access to your cryptocurrency assets, and the operator is not responsible for such losses.

5. By using the Interface, you acknowledge the risks associated with cryptocurrency transactions, including hardware or software failure, internet connectivity issues, and network failures. The Interface may be suspended or terminated at the operator’s discretion, which could affect your access to your cryptocurrency assets.

6) **Links to Third-Party Services:** The Interface may contain links to external websites or services operated by third parties. The operator makes no representations or warranties about these external services, and your use of them may be governed by separate terms. The operator assumes no liability for content, services, or transactions conducted via third-party platforms.

7. **Cryptographic Systems:** You acknowledge the inherent risks of cryptographic systems, including the possibility of hacking or rapid technological changes that may impact the security or value of digital assets. The operator does not control or access your private keys. Losing control of your private keys or seed phrases may result in the permanent loss of access to your assets. For any cryptographic tokens or other digital assets stored on resources hosted by the operator, the operator is not liable for any loss, failure, or unavailability of such tokens or assets, for any reason, including network or system failures.

8) **Legal Disclaimer:** Nothing in these terms or on this website constitutes investment advice, nor is it an offer to sell or solicitation to purchase any securities, tokens, or financial products. You should consult with independent financial, legal, and tax advisors before making any investment decisions. The operator is not liable for any investment decisions you make based on the information provided on the Interface. Some jurisdictions may restrict the use of certain blockchain services or cryptocurrency transactions. It is your responsibility to comply with the laws of your jurisdiction, and the operator disclaims any liability for your failure to do so.

9. **Taxes:** You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your transactions on the Interface and for reporting and paying the correct amounts to the appropriate tax authorities. The operator is not responsible for determining the tax implications of your activities.

10) **NFT Transactions:** All non-fungible token (NFT) transactions conducted through the Interface are final and irreversible. You bear full responsibility for ensuring that you wish to proceed with any such transaction. The operator is not a party to NFT transactions unless explicitly stated and is not liable for any losses associated with NFT purchases.

11. **AtomOne Name:** Any reference to “AtomOne” on this website refers to the decentralized AtomOne community and anticipated hub chain. The operator reserves all rights to the term/mark “AtomOne.” However, the software and documentation published by the operator are licensed under a copyleft license, allowing others to use, modify, and fork the chain.

12) **Forward-Looking Statements:** Certain statements on this website (or in linked materials) may be forward-looking in nature. Forward-looking statements can often be identified by terms such as “intend,” “plan,” “estimate,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “predict,” “project,” “propose,” “assume,” “forecast,” “outlook,” “future,” “goal,” “potential,” “continue,” “may,” “can,” “will,” “should,” “could,” and similar expressions. These statements are predictions based on current expectations and assumptions regarding future events. However, they do not guarantee any specific outcomes or achievements, and actual results may differ materially due to various known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors. Readers are cautioned against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.

13. **Private Key Security:** Participation in GovGen requires only the sharing of public keys, never your private keys or seed phrases. You will never be contacted by the operator asking for your private key, seed phrase, or recovery phrase. Any such request should be considered fraudulent and reported immediately. Safeguarding your private keys and seed phrases is your responsibility, and failure to do so may result in theft of your digital identity and assets.

14) **Use of Blockchain and Decentralized Services:** By using the Interface, you acknowledge the inherent risks of decentralized blockchain technology, including the irreversibility of transactions, potential software bugs or exploits, market volatility, and lack of recourse in the event of unauthorized access to your wallet. The operator is not liable for any losses or damages arising from these risks.
