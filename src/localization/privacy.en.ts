**Effective Date: November 18, 2024**

This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) governs your use of the website, accessible from [https://atom.one](https://atom.one), and any Website, Services, Platform or Interface associated with AtomOne such as the AtomOne Staking Portal at [https://staking.atom.one/](https://staking.atom.one/) and the AtomOne Governance dApp at [https://gov.atom.one/](https://gov.atom.one/) and related tools, trademarks, intellectual property, services, software, or any public source code repository offered by the operator of this site (collectively, the “Services”). 

All in Bits (AiB), Inc., a Delaware corporation, operates the Services. AiB and its affiliates are referred to in this document as the “operator,” “we,” or “us.” The Services do not include outside websites or platforms which may be linked or interconnected to the Services. Such outside platforms may have their own privacy policy, which controls all transactions on such platforms.

If you do not want us to collect, use, or disclose your personal data in the ways described in this Policy, please do not use or otherwise interact with the Services, provide us with your personal data, or authorize any third party to make your personal data available to us. By using or interacting with the Services, you acknowledge that you understand that we may use your personal data as described in this Policy.

Please note, as described in this Policy, we may receive your personal data from third parties that have not expressly told you that they will provide your personal data to us. If you have any questions about how we collect, use, protect, or disclose your personal data in connection with our platform, please contact us by email at <legal{'@'}allinbits.com>.

**1. Scope and Applicability**  
This Privacy Policy explains how All in Bits, Inc. collects, uses, discloses, and protects your information when you access or use the Services and related web-hosted user interfaces at  [https://atom.one](https://atom.one), [https://staking.atom.one/](https://staking.atom.one/) and [https://gov.atom.one/](https://gov.atom.one/) (collectively, the “Interface”). By accessing or using the Interface, you consent to the collection and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.

This Policy also describes how we handle both personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) and non-personally identifiable information, and how we protect your privacy when using decentralized services. It applies to information collected through the Interface and related services provided by All in Bits, Inc.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to third-party services, platforms, or websites that may be linked to or interact with the Interface. Each third-party platform has its own privacy policy, and we are not responsible for the content or practices of such external services.

Due to the decentralized nature of the Interface, certain information may be shared or published publicly on the blockchain, and such information cannot be deleted or altered once recorded. Transactions and interactions conducted on the blockchain are inherently transparent and accessible to the public, and by using the Interface, you acknowledge and accept this risk.

**2. Blockchain Technology and Immutable Data**

Blockchain technology, also known as distributed ledger technology (DLT), is at the core of our business. Blockchains are decentralized and consist of digitally recorded data in a chain of packages called ‘blocks’. Once recorded, this data is immutable, meaning that it cannot be changed or deleted.

Because of the decentralized nature of blockchain, this may impact your ability to exercise certain data protection rights such as your right to erasure (‘right to be forgotten’) or your right to object to or restrict the processing of your personal data.

If your use of our services involves writing certain personal data onto the blockchain (e.g., wallet address or transaction data), this data may be public and permanently visible on the blockchain. While certain access rights may be revoked, it will not be possible to delete or change the data once it is recorded.

You are responsible for transacting on the blockchain and sharing your public wallet address, which means that you should be aware of the associated privacy risks. We encourage you not to share personal data that you do not want to become publicly visible on the blockchain.

**3. Information We Collect**

1. **Information You Provide:** We collect Personal Information directly from you when you voluntarily provide it to us. This includes:

   2. **Transaction Data:** When using the AtomOne dApp, we may collect details about the proposals you submit, votes you cast, and other governance-related actions. However, we do not collect your private keys or wallet seed phrases.  
   3. **Verification Information (if applicable):** In some cases, we may collect Know Your Customer (KYC) information, such as government-issued IDs, utility bills, or other documents, to comply with applicable laws, including U.S. Bank Secrecy Act or anti-money laundering laws.  
2. **Automatically Collected Information:** We may automatically collect **non-personally identifiable information**, including:
